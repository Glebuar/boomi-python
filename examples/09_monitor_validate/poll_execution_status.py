üö® CRITICAL TODO: IMPLEMENT - Poll Execution Status

This example demonstrates how to monitor execution progress and wait for completion.

Features to implement:
- Poll execution status with configurable intervals
- Wait for completion with timeout
- Handle different execution states (running, complete, error)
- Return final execution result

Requirements:
- Set environment variables: BOOMI_ACCOUNT, BOOMI_USER, BOOMI_SECRET

Usage:
    python poll_execution_status.py EXECUTION_ID [--timeout 300]
    
Required Endpoints:
- ExecutionRecord/query - Check execution status
- ExecutionSummaryRecord/query - Get execution summary

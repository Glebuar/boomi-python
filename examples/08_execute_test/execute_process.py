üö® CRITICAL TODO: IMPLEMENT - Execute Process

This example demonstrates how to execute a process on a runtime.

Features to implement:
- Execute process by ID on specific atom
- Pass execution parameters
- Handle execution options (async/sync)
- Return execution ID for monitoring

Requirements:
- Set environment variables: BOOMI_ACCOUNT, BOOMI_USER, BOOMI_SECRET

Usage:
    python execute_process.py PROCESS_ID ATOM_ID [--async]
    
Required Endpoints:
- ExecutionRequest (POST) - Execute process
- ExecutionRecord/query - Monitor execution

🚨 CRITICAL TODO: IMPLEMENT - Execute Process with Test Payload

This example demonstrates how to execute a process with test data.

Features to implement:
- Execute process with custom test payload
- Support different payload formats (JSON, XML, CSV)
- Load test data from files
- Validate payload format before execution

Requirements:
- Set environment variables: BOOMI_ACCOUNT, BOOMI_USER, BOOMI_SECRET

Usage:
    python execute_process_with_payload.py PROCESS_ID ATOM_ID --payload test_data.json
    
Required Endpoints:
- ExecutionRequest (POST) - Execute with data
- ExecutionArtifacts (GET) - Retrieve output data

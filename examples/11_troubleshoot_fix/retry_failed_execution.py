🚧 TODO: IMPLEMENT - Retry Failed Execution

This example demonstrates how to retry a failed execution.

Features to implement:
- Retry execution with same or modified parameters
- Handle transient vs permanent failures
- Implement retry strategies (immediate, delayed, exponential backoff)
- Track retry attempts

Requirements:
- Set environment variables: BOOMI_ACCOUNT, BOOMI_USER, BOOMI_SECRET

Usage:
    python retry_failed_execution.py EXECUTION_ID [--max-retries 3]
    
Required Endpoints:
- ExecutionRequest (POST) - Re-execute process
- ExecutionRecord/query - Check original failure

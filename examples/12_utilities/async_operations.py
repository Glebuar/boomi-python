🚧 TODO: IMPLEMENT - Async Operations Management

This example demonstrates how to work with asynchronous operations.

Features to implement:
- Start long-running async operations
- Poll operation status with token
- Retrieve async operation results
- Handle async timeouts and errors

Requirements:
- Set environment variables: BOOMI_ACCOUNT, BOOMI_USER, BOOMI_SECRET

Usage:
    python async_operations.py --operation AtomCounters --atom-id ATOM_ID --poll-interval 5
    
Required Endpoints:
- async_* endpoints - Various async operations
- async_*_response_{token} - Get async results

These APIs allow for control of many objects associated with your account. \n\n ## Platform API \n The Boomi Platform API provides programmatic access to the Boomi Enterprise Platform functionality.\n The API is built around an object/verb hierarchy. This hierarchy parallels the basic object-oriented programming paradigm as well as the web service implementation behind [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).\n\n- Objects represent structures and relationships within the Enterprise platform, such as Account, Account User Role, Atom Startup Properties, and Environment.\n\n- Verbs are the operations performed for each object, such as GET, QUERY, and UPDATE. These verbs are object-based operations. Verbs that do not fall into the object/verb hierarchy, such as executeProcess, are action-based operations.\n\nAll Platform API calls use an API token or user name for authentication and an account ID associated with an active account. For any API call, the account ID is the general context. For example, suppose you make an API call to run a QUERY of the Account Groups object without applying query filters. In that case, the query returns all account groups owned by the authenticated account. If you are using single sign-on, you need to use an [API token](https://help.boomi.com/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/int-AtomSphere_API_Tokens_page_6a75a1f6-709c-4b08-b3bd-85fe2ac02e18) to authenticate.\n\nBoomi developed the API RESTish and SOAP implementations.\n\n>**Note:** Integration also provides: \n >- The Platform Partner API, which supports additional partner-specific operations. \n >- The Platform API and Platform Partner API connectors, which enable you to perform API object-based operations and actions within your integration processes.\n\n### Implementation\n\n All RESTish API endpoint URLs begin with the prefix: \n\n ```shell\nhttps://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/{accountID}\n```\n\nwhere `accountID` is your account ID. The complete endpoint URL depends on the operation you are trying to perform. The description of each associated API object-based operation provides complete URLs in addition to action topics within this Help guide.\n\n>**Note:**  Integration-specific Boomi Platform API and Partner REST APIs are also available from the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. Because OpenAPI 3.0 is language agnostic, it enables users to easily discover available Integration API and Partner API objects and actions, test requests and responses, and understand the API's functionality. \n\n HTTP Basic Authentication protects RESTish requests, requiring either your [Platform API token](https://help.boomi.com/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/int-AtomSphere_API_Tokens_page_6a75a1f6-709c-4b08-b3bd-85fe2ac02e18) or user name and password credentials.\n\nRequest and response bodies for RESTish requests are XML by default. The XML schema, which is the same for both the RESTish API and the SOAP API, is located at:\n\n```shell\nhttps://api.boomi.com/api/soap/v1/{accountID}?xsd=1\n```\n\nYou can use JSON-formatted request bodies in RESTish calls by sending the request with the HTTP header `Content-Type: application/json`. To receive JSON-formatted responses, send the request with the HTTP header `Accept: application/json`.\n\nYou can configure CORS \\(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\\) request matching rules for your account to enable cross-server, JavaScript-powered RESTish requests.\n\n## Partner API \n\nThe Boomi Platform Partner API provides partners with programmatic access to the secondary accounts that they manage.\n\nThe Partner API shares many of the same implementation details as the standard Boomi Enterprise Platform API. The main differences between the two APIs are:\n\n-   In addition to the standard Platform API operations, the Partner API supports certain operations that are not available in the standard API:\n\n    -   Account CREATE and DELETE operations\n\n    -   Cancel Execution and Account Provision operations\n\n-   Most Boomi Partner API requests take an optional account override parameter that you can use to override the authenticated account. For a RESTish, implementation the parameter is `overrideAccount`. For SOAP, the parameter is called `accountId`.\n\n    The account override parameter enables you to perform a request against the specified account; the override value becomes the effective account that runs the call. For example, if the authenticated account is primary, a request can override the account ID with Sub01 to perform the request on Sub01 rather than primary. Of course, the primary account must be in the hierarchy of the Sub01 account for the request to pass authorization and authentication logic.\n\n   >**Note:** The Account CREATE and DELETE operations and the Account Provision operation do not support the account override parameter.\n\nThe Boomi Platform Partner API connector enables partner accounts to perform API object-based operations and actions within their integration processes. You can override the account to which a request applies by defining a process property called `boomiPartnerApi-overrideAccountId` in the Boomi Platform Partner API connector operation.\n\n  An optional account property `overrideAccountRateLimit` allows the rate limit to be determined based on the specific account requested, whether it’s a primary or an override account. The application of this rate limit depends on the setting of the `overrideAccountRateLimit` property in the primary account. If this property is enabled, the rate limit defined for the override account will apply. If it is disabled, the rate limit of the primary account will apply. \n\n When you make an API request without specifying the override account, the rate limit of the primary account will apply if the `overrideAccountRateLimit` property is enabled.  \n\n >**Note:** Contact your Boomi representative to enable the `overrideAccountRateLimit` feature for your account. \n\n>**Note:** You must explicitly enable access to the Boomi Partner API. Contact your representative to allow the Partner API for your account.\n\n>**Note:** The RESTish implementation of the Partner API uses the standard Boomi Platform API namespace for both structure and objects.\n\n### Partner API implementation \n\n#### REST\n\nMost Partner API RESTish requests take an optional account ID parameter that you can use to set the effective account. In addition, it adds the account override parameter to each request as a query string parameter called `overrideAccount`.\n\nThe following two code samples illustrate the difference between the Boomi Platform API GET request and the Partner API GET request for a Deployment object.\n\n**Platform API GET**\n\n```powershell\nhttps://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}/Deployment/XXXXX\n```\n\n**Partner API GET**\n\n```powershell\nhttps://api.boomi.com/partner/api/rest/v1/{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}/Deployment/XXXXX?overrideAccount=OVERRIDE_ACCOUNT_ID\n```\n>**Note:** For all requests, the structure of responses from the Boomi Platform API and the Partner API are the same.\n\n>**Note:** Integration-specific Boomi Platform API and Partner REST APIs are also available from the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. Because OpenAPI 3.0 is language agnostic, it enables users to easily discover available Integration API and Partner API objects and actions, test requests and responses, and understand the API's functionality. \n\n To checkout the partner specific APIs, refer to [Platform Partner API Reference](/api/platformpartnerapi).\n\n\n## Platform API and Partner API authentication\n\nReview the different authentication methods that users can employ to successfully make calls to the Boomi Platform API and Boomi Platform Partner API.\n\n### User name and password credentials\n\nSingle sign-on \\(SSO\\) Administration users and regular users \\(non-SSO\\) can authenticate calls to the Boomi Platform and Partner APIs using their user name and password credentials in a Basic Auth type authorization.\n\n### Platform API tokens\n\nIf single sign-on \\(SSO\\) users do not have Administrator privileges, they must use API tokens to authenticate any Boomi Platform or Partner API calls. Similarly, users that enable two-factor authentication \\(2FA\\) on their accounts can authenticate their API calls using a single API token rather than manually entering individual authentication codes per API call.\n\n>**Note:** Regular non-SSO users and administrators who use SSO can also use API tokens to authenticate their APIs. They must follow the same instructions for using the token's value in the request header described below. For instance, use the API token feature if the user wants to limit API calls to a specific account.\n\n<iframe width=\"400px\" height=\"300px\" src=\"https://embed.app.guidde.com/playbooks/nSvxucmdusmGXejTQywYE6\" title=\"Creating an API token\" frameborder=\"0\" referrerpolicy=\"unsafe-url\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"clipboard-write\" sandbox=\"allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-scripts allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n\nUsers generate API tokens for their account from the **Settings** > **Account Information and Setup** > **Platform API Tokens** page and use the token's value in place of a password:\n\n- When making manual calls to the Boomi Platform or Partner APIs, users must enter the API token value within the password field of a Basic Auth type authorization. In addition, the user name value must be the Boomi Platform user name authenticating the request and be in the form of `BOOMI_TOKEN.<username>`.\n\n- When making automatic calls to the Boomi Platform or Partner APIs, users must replace the `<username:password>` value in the Basic Auth header with `BOOMI_TOKEN.<username>:<token_value>`.\n\n  For example, the following shows a user using an API token to authenticate a GET request made to the Audit Log object:\n\n  ```powershell\n  curl --user \"BOOMI_TOKEN.user@boomi.com:123aab45-67b8-9012-3a45-67c8e9e01e23\" --request GET 'https://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/account123/AuditLog/documentId-321' \n  ```\n  \n```powershell\nhttps://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}/Deployment/XXXXX\n```\n\nFor more information about API tokens and how to add them to your account, refer to the [API Tokens](https://help.boomi.com/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/int-AtomSphere_API_Tokens_page_6a75a1f6-709c-4b08-b3bd-85fe2ac02e18) page.\n\n### Two-factor authentication\n\nAs described in the previous section, you can generate and use an API token to make calls from accounts enabled with 2FA. For any calls that you wish to automate, encourages you to use API tokens.\n\nIn some cases, however, you may be making less frequent, ad-hoc calls and do not require the automation benefits that a token provides. For such calls, simply include X-Boomi-OTP as an HTTP header and set the time-based one-time password \\(TOTP\\) authentication code as its value. For more information about 2FA, see the topic [Two-factor authentication](https://help.boomi.com/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/c-atm-Two-factor_authentication_b539d687-2384-4d0c-8f17-75e066e9269a) and all related subtopics.\n\n### JWT authentication tokens\n\nYou can generate a JWT token to use JWT to authenticate calls to certain Boomi Platform APIs, the Master Data Hub Repository API, and GraphQL APIs.\n\nTo generate a JWT token, you must use HTTP Basic authentication and provide your Boomi Enterprise Platform account username and password in a GET request to the Boomi Platform API.\n\nSend a GET request to `https://api.boomi.com/auth/jwt/generate/{accountId}`, where `{accountId}` is the ID of the authenticating accout for the request. You can obtain your Enterprise Platform account information in **Settings \\> User Information \\> Account Information**.\n\n>**Note:** JWT tokens expire after 5 minutes. If you make a request with an expired token, you will receive a 401 error.\n\n## OpenAPI 3.0\n\nOpenAPI 3.0 \\(formerly Swagger Specification\\) is an API specification available for Boomi Enterprise Platform and Partner REST APIs within the service.\n\nThe [OpenAPI 3.0 Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) \\(OAS\\) enables clients to more easily use and understand Boomi's REST APIs. Because of its language-agnostic interface, clients can use the OpenAPI specification \\(OAS\\) with common API tools to programmatically discover available Boomi Platform API and Partner API endpoints. Users can also generate sample requests and responses based on a refined schema and more easily explore and test APIs using common tooling without needing to reference complex code or additional help documentation. The ease and accuracy of OAS documentation also allows you to detect defects early in your development cycle and alleviates strain on your continuous integration pipeline.\n\n### Using OAS with common API tools\n\nYou can easily access OpenAPI 3.0 documentation for Integration's platform and Partner APIs using any tool of your choosing, such as Postman. Use the following general instructions to import the available Boomi Platform API and Partner API collection to your specific tool:\n\n1.  Open an API tool, such as Postman.\n2.  Click **File** \\> **Import**.\n3.  Click the **Link** tab.\n4.  From your API tool, do one of the following:\n\n    a.  To make calls to an Boomi Enterprise Platform API, copy and paste `https://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/<platform_account_ID>/openapi.json` into the URL field.\n\n    b.  To make calls to a Partner API, copy and paste `https://api.boomi.com/partner/api/rest/v1/<platform_account_ID>/openapi.json` into the URL field where `<platform_account_ID>` is the account ID.\n\n5.  Replace `<platform_account_ID>` in the URL with the ID of the authenticating account from which you want to make requests.\n6.  Click **Continue**.\n7.  Under **Show Advanced Settings**, optionally change the **Folder Organization** selection to **Tags**.\n8.  Click **Import**. This actions adds Boomi Platform APIs or Partner APIs to your collection.\n9.  Open the **Collections** tab of your tool and select your new collection, titled either Boomi Platform API or Partner API. From here, you can enter your credentials to globally apply authentication to all requests within that collection.\n\n    a.  Under the **Authorization** tab, select **Basic Auth** as the authentication type and enter your sign-in credentials.\n\n    b.  If you are using a Boomi Enterprise Platform API token instead, enter `BOOMI_TOKEN.<your_boomi_platform_user_name>` in the **Username** field and the API token in the **Password** field.\n\n    c.  If you want to grant different account permission to the collection, change the values of the **Username** and **Password** fields in the **Authorization** tab. Then, under the **Variables** tab, modify the **CURRENT VALUE** field with the new account ID. \n\n >**Note:** You must use an API token if you enable your account with two-factor authentication \\(2FA\\) or single sign-on \\(SSO\\). \n\n 10. In your new collection, you can see the list of available APIs and expand them to view their available operations.\n11. Test out an API object and configure URL and request parameters as appropriate. Click **Send** and view the results.\n\n\n## API errors \n\nThe Platform API and the Partner API return standard HTTP status codes or SOAP fault codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.\n\nprovides standard HTTP status codes and clear messaging to help you identify and correct potential errors with your API call. Boomi Platform API and Partner APIs return the following potential error statuses.\n\n### 2xx Success \n\nThe Platform API or Partner API returns 200-type statuses when the call is successful. However, some success statuses can also indicate additional complications that you must address:\n\n-   **200**—The request is successful.\n-   **202**— The request did not finish processing and requires more wait time. Clients typically encounter this status in the context of asynchronous APIs.\n-   **204**— There is a successful exchange between client and server, but there is no content or data at the requested URL. For example, the client encounters a 204 code in the second half of an asynchronous API after retrieving the content successfully or deleting the content automatically after 30 minutes. \n\n ### 3xx Redirection \n\n The Platform API or Partner API returns 300-type statuses when a retired API object is no longer available for use and there exists a replacement URL pointing to the newer functionality: \n\n - **301**— This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI. The request method can change, such as from a GET to a POST request.\n - **308**― Similar to 301, all future requests should be redirected to the given URL. However, 308 doesn't allow the HTTP method to change. The user must repeat the exact same request method as the original request. \n\n### 4xx Client request issues \n\nThe Platform API or Partner API returns 400-type statuses when the client does not correct authentication or permissions to complete the call. The following list describes the various 400-type statuses one may receive.\n\n-   **400**— The server was unable to proceed with the request, most likely due to bad syntax in the request URL or body. To fix these errors, ensure that the request or endpoint URL is properly formed. See documentation for your particular API object or operation for specific call examples. \n - **401**— You cannot be authenticated due to bad credentials for the target resource. Ensure that you're using valid user ID and password. \n-   **403**— You're authenticated but not authorized or doesn’t have permissions to perform the requested action. If you encounter a 403 error, check that you have correct permissions and authorized access to the account specified in the API endpoint.\n-   **404**— Made a call to an API endpoint that does not exist. Ensure that the endpoint URL points to a valid API or that there is a properly formed request body.\n-   **410**— The API is retired or the specified Runtime is currently offline.\n\n### 5xx Service Unavailable \n\nThe Platform API or Boomi Partner API returns 500-type statuses when the API cannot complete the call due to a service interruption. The following list describes the various 500-type statuses one may receive.\n\n-   **503**— The server is too busy or the client exceeded the allotted rate limit. Have the client try again later.\n-   **504**— The client cannot reach the Runtime or the server at this time. Have the client try again later.\n\n### Sample response\n\nFor errors encountered during a REST request, an error message is returned along with the appropriate HTTP status code. The following is an example error message for which the HTTP status code is either 400 \\(indicating an error with the clients request\\) or 500 \\(indicating a server error\\).\n\n<details>\n<summary>XML response:</summary> \n\n ```xml\n<error>\n    <message>ERROR_MESSAGE</message>\n</error>\n``` \n </details> \n\n <details>\n<summary>JSON response:</summary> \n\n ```JSON \n {\n   \"error\": {\n      \"message\": \"ERROR_MESSAGE\"\n    }\n}\n``` \n\n </details>  \n\n## API connectors\n\nThe Platform API connector and Platform Partner API connector enable you to perform API object-based operations and actions within your integration processes.\n\nThe design of the API connectors connect seamlessly with the Platform. Integrating with the platform consists of web service calls utilizing a SOAP request and response setup over an HTTPS connection. The technical details of this connection, such as request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection, are all abstracted to simplify your implementation.\n\nThe object-based operations and actions available in the Boomi Platform API connector and Boomi Platform Partner API connector are the same as those in the equivalent API.\n\nUsing an API connector in an integration process can make working with the underlying API easier. The API connectors:\n\n- Allow you to select from a list of available objects and actions.\n\n- Provide an expression builder for creating query filters.\n\n- Handle query paging for you by using the `queryMore` token automatically. As a result, the API connectors do not limit the number of records returned by a Query request.\n\n- Detect API response errors automatically, and either fail a document or set the Application Status Code document property accordingly.\n\n- Handle HTTP 503 Service Unavailable errors automatically by retrying a request up to five times. HTTP 503 errors can result from an account exceeding its API usage limit, such as five requests per second. Retrying the request at a different time might resolve the issue.\n\n>**Note:** Deploying a Platform API connector or Platform Partner API connector does not affect your license count. You can deploy these API connectors unlimited times across different Runtimes and environments.\n\n\nThe Platform Partner API connector, like the Partner API itself, provides Boomi Platform partners with programmatic access to the subaccounts that they manage. As a partner, you can override the account to which a request applies by defining a process property called `boomiPartnerApi-overrideAccountId` in the connector operation.\n\nFor the following API operations, use the Boomi Platform Partner API connector rather than the Platform API connector:\n\n- Account Group operations\n- Account Group Account operations\n- Account Group User Role operations\n- Cancel execution operation\n- Provision Partner Customer Account operation\n\n\n## Bulk GET operations \n\nThe bulk GET operation returns a maximum of 100 multiple API objects based on the supplied object IDs.\n\nMost Boomi Platform API objects that support the ordinary GET operation also support a bulk GET operation. With a bulk GET operation, you specify the object type and up to 100 object IDs. The operation returns all objects having the specified IDs.\n\nThe following example bulk GET requests are for the Process object.\n\n### Implementation \n\nSend an HTTP POST to:\n\n```powershell\nhttps://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/{accountId}/Process/bulk\n```\n\nwhere `accountId` is the ID of the authenticating account for the request.\n\nNote that a specific process ID is replaced with the word `bulk` in the endpoint URL.\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h4>XML request</h4></summary>\n\n    \n    <api:BulkRequest xmlns:api=\"http://api.platform.boomi.com/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" type=\"GET\">\n      <api:request xsi:type=\"api:BulkId\" id=\"56789abc-def0-1234-5678-9abcdef01234\"/>\n      <api:request xsi:type=\"api:BulkId\" id=\"not_a_real_process_id\"/>\n      <api:request xsi:type=\"api:BulkId\" id=\"6789abcd-ef01-2345-6780-abcdef012345\"/>\n    </api:BulkRequest>\n </details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h4>XML response</h4></summary>\n\n    <bns:BulkResult xmlns:bns=\"http://api.platform.boomi.com/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n      <bns:response statusCode=\"200\">\n          <bns:Result xsi:type=\"bns:Process\" id=\"56789abc-def0-1234-5678-9abcdef01234\" name=\"Order Intake\"/>\n      </bns:response>\n      <bns:response errorMessage=\"No such process\" statusCode=\"400\" id=\"not_a_real_process_ID\"/>\n      <bns:response statusCode=\"200\">\n          <bns:Result xsi:type=\"bns:Process\" id=\"6789abcd-ef01-2345-6780-abcdef012345\" name=\"Order Process\"/>\n      </bns:response>\n    </bns:BulkResult>\n</details>\n\nFor a JSON request, send the request with the following HTTP header:\n\n`Content-Type: application/json`\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h4>JSON request</h4></summary>\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"type\" : \"GET\",\n    \"request\" : [\n      {\n        \"id\" : \"56789abc-def0-1234-5678-9abcdef01234\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\" : \"not_a_real_process_id\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\" : \"6789abcd-ef01-2345-6780-abcdef012345\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n</details>\n\nFor a JSON response, send the request with the following HTTP header:\n\n`Accept: application/json`\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h4>JSON response</h4></summary>\n\n    {\n      \"@type\" : \"BulkResult\",\n      \"response\" : [ \n        {\n          \"@type\" : \"BulkResponse\",\n          \"Result\" : \n            {\n              \"@type\" : \"Process\",\n              \"IntegrationPack\" : [ ],\n              \"name\" : \"Order Intake\",\n              \"id\" : \"56789abc-def0-1234-5678-9abcdef01234\"\n            },\n          \"statusCode\" : 200\n        },\n        {\n          \"@type\" : \"BulkResponse\",\n          \"id\" : \"not_a_real_process_id\",\n          \"statusCode\" : 400,\n          \"errorMessage\" : \"No such process\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"@type\" : \"BulkResponse\",\n          \"Result\" : \n            {\n              \"@type\" : \"Process\",\n              \"IntegrationPack\" : [ ],\n              \"name\" : \"Order Process\",\n              \"id\" : \"6789abcd-ef01-2345-6780-abcdef012345\"\n            },\n          \"statusCode\" : 200\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n</details>\n\n\n\n## Bulk UPDATE operations\n\nThe Bulk UPDATE operation updates multiple API objects based on the supplied object IDs.\n\nWith a Bulk UPDATE operation, you specify the object type and up to a specific number of object IDs. The operation updates all objects having the specified IDs.\n\n\n>**Note:** Typically, the Bulk UPDATE operation can apply updates up to 100 object IDs. However, only the Process Schedules object currently supports the Bulk UPDATE operation and is limited to 15 objects.\n\nThe following example Bulk UPDATE requests are for the Process Schedules object.\n\n### Implementation\n\n**UPDATE operation**\n\nSend an HTTP POST to:\n\n```powershell\nhttps://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/{accountId}/ProcessSchedules/bulk\n```\n\nwhere `accountId` is the ID of the authenticating account for the request.\n\nFor a JSON request, send the request with the following HTTP header:\n\n```json\nContent-Type: application/json\n```\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h4>JSON request</h4></summary>\n\n    {\n        \"type\": \"UPDATE\",\n        \"request\": [\n            {\n                \"Schedule\": [\n                    {\n                        \"minutes\":

to perform complex queries. You can compose a query filter with simple expressions and by grouping expressions.\n\n### Simple expressions in query filters \n\nA simple expression consists of:\n\n-   A property, or field, whose value is to be tested\n\n-   An operator, which describes the type of comparison to perform\n\n-   Zero or more arguments\n\n\nThe following table lists all available operators and the acceptable number of arguments. See the specific API object topics for information about what fields you can use as query filters and the allowed operators for that object.\n\n|Operator|Description|Number of Arguments|\n|--------|-----------|-------------------|\n|EQUALS|Equal To|1|\n|LIKE|Like|1|\n|NOT\\_EQUALS|Not Equal To|1|\n|IS\\_NULL|Is Null|0|\n|IS\\_NOT\\_NULL|Is Not Null|0|\n|STARTS\\_WITH|Starts With|1|\n|BETWEEN|Between|2|\n|GREATER\\_THAN|Greater Than|1|\n|GREATER\\_THAN\\_OR\\_EQUAL|Greater Than Or Equal|1|\n|LESS\\_THAN|Less Than|1|\n|LESS\\_THAN\\_OR\\_EQUAL|Less Than Or Equal|1|\n\n

The following examples illustrate a complex grouping expression.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>JSON</summary>\n\n    \n        {\n            \"QueryFilter\": {\n                \"expression\": {\n                    \"operator\": \"and\",\n                    \"nestedExpression\": [\n                        {\n                            \"argument\" : [\"123\"],\n                            \"operator\":\"EQUALS\",\n                            \"property\":\"ABC\"\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"argument\" : [\"456\", \"789\"],\n                            \"operator\":\"BETWEEN\",\n                            \"property\":\"DEF\"\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"operator\":\"and\",\n                            \"nestedExpression\": [\n                                {\n                                    \"argument\" : [\"123\"],\n                                    \"operator\":\"GREATER_THAN\",\n                                    \"property\":\"GHI\"\n                                },\n                                {\n                                    \"argument\" : [\"0\"],\n                                    \"operator\":\"EQUALS\",\n                                    \"property\":\"JKL\"\n                                }\n                            ]\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            }\n        }\n   \n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>XML</summary>\n    \n    \n    <expression operator=\"and\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"GroupingExpression\">\n        <nestedExpression operator=\"EQUALS\" property=\"ABC\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"SimpleExpression\">\n            <argument>123</argument>\n        </nestedExpression>\n        <nestedExpression operator=\"BETWEEN\" property=\"DEF\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"SimpleExpression\">\n            <argument>456</argument>\n            <argument>789</argument>\n        </nestedExpression>\n        <nestedExpression operator=\"and\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"GroupingExpression\">\n            <nestedExpression operator=\"GREATER_THAN\" property=\"GHI\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"SimpleExpression\">\n                <argument>123</argument>\n            </nestedExpression>\n            <nestedExpression operator=\"EQUALS\" property=\"JKL\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"SimpleExpression\">\n                <argument>0</argument>\n            </nestedExpression>\n        </nestedExpression>\n    </expression>\n   \n</details>\n\n ## Query paging \n\nQuery paging helps you manage the number of results returned by an Boomi Platform API request.\n\nThe results from QUERY requests are paged to keep the size of responses at acceptable levels. The maximum number of results returned per QUERY response is 100. When there are more than 100 results, the response contains a `queryToken`. You can retrieve additional results by specifying the `queryToken` in a `queryMore` request.\n\n>**Note:** The Platform API connector and Platform Partner API connector handle query paging for you. When you use an API connector in a process, there is no limit to the number of results returned by a Query request.\n\n### REST\n\nThe following is an example of an XML response that contains a `queryToken`:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h4>XML</h4></summary>\n\n   ```xml\n   <bns:QueryResult numberOfResults=\"100\" xmlns=\"http://api.platform.boomi.com/\">\n      <bns:queryToken>EXAMPLE_QUERY_TOKEN</bns:queryToken>\n      <bns:result xsi:type=\"bns:\">\n      </bns:result>\n      ...\n      <bns:result xsi:type=\"bns:\">\n      </bns:result>\n   </bns:QueryResult>\n   ```\n</details>\n\nTo perform the `queryMore` request, send an HTTP POST to:\n\n```powershell\nhttps://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/{accountId}/objectType/queryMore\n```\n\nwhere `accountId` is the ID of the authenticating account for the request and `objectType` is the type of object you are querying \\(such as Account\\).\n\nTo make a `queryMore` request, you need to provide *only the token value* in the body of an XML or JSON request to obtain the next page of results, for example:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h4>JSON</h4></summary>\n\n   ```json\n   {\n      \"@type\": \"QueryResult\",\n      \"queryToken\":

Sharing \\(CORS\\) protocol.\n\nSupport for the [CORS](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) protocol enables the Platform APIs to circumvent a browser’s same-origin policy, thereby enabling you to implement cross-server, JavaScript-powered API requests.\n\nBy using `Access-Control-...` HTTP headers, CORS essentially allows JavaScript from one origin \\(server\\) to request permission from another origin \\(server\\) to make RESTish API requests.\n\nTo enable CORS requests under a account, you must configure CORS request matching rules for the account on the CORS page \\(**Settings** \\> **Account Information and Setup** \\> **Boomi Platform API** \\> **CORS**\\). Each rule specifies:\n\n-   An origin for matching cross-server RESTish API requests under the account. The matching criteria specified for an origin are protocol \\(HTTP or HTTPS\\), originating domain, and originating port. A matching request is one that matches on all criteria.\n\n-   The allowed HTTP methods — GET, POST, DELETE — for matched requests.\n\n\n### CORS request types \n\nThere are two types of CORS requests:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h3>Preflight</h3></summary>\n    A preflight request is used by a browser running JavaScript to determine whether they have permission to perform a given action. The browser sends an API request to determine whether the HTTP method for that type of request is accepted under that account from the origin server.\n\n    Preflight requests must conform with the following requirements:\n\n    -   Specify the HTTP OPTIONS method.\n\n    -   Include the `Origin` header.\n\n    -   Specify the HTTP method for the API request as the `Access-Control-Request-Method` header value.\n\n    Preflight requests are not authenticated. Preflight responses may be cached for up to one hour \\(3,600 seconds\\), as indicated by the `Access-Control-Max-Age` header value in the response.\n\n    The following is an example of an excerpt from a preflight request:\n\n    ```json\n    OPTIONS /api/rest/v1/account-123456/Atom/3456789a-bcde-f012-3456-789abcdef012 HTTP/1.1\n    Origin: https://mydomain.com\n    Access-Control-Request-Method: DELETE\n    Access-Control-Request-Headers: accept, authorization, content-type\n\n    ```\n\n    If the target API request is of a type allowed under the requesting account from the origin server, an excerpt from the response would be as follows:\n\n    ```json\n    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: cache-control,content-type,expires,last-modified,accept,content-language,authorization,pragma\n    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://mydomain.com\n    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, DELETE\n    Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600\n    ```\n\n    If the target API request is *not* of a type allowed under the requesting account from the origin server, the response status code would be 401 Unauthorized.\n\n </details> \n\n  >**Note:** Preflight requests are not required for cross-origin requests that can be made from a browser without using CORS, such as an HTML form POST.\n\n<details>\n<summary><h3>Normal</h3></summary>\n\n    If the response to a preflight request is positive — the specified type of API request from the specified origin is allowed under the requesting account — the browser then submits the normal request. Normal requests consist of:\n\n    -   an API request of the type specified as the target in the preflight request\n\n    -   the same account and `Origin` header specified in the preflight request\n\n    Normal requests require authentication.\n\n    The following is an example of an excerpt from a normal request:\n\n    ```json\n    DELETE /api/rest/v1/account-123456/Atom/3456789a-bcde-f012-3456-789abcdef012 HTTP/1.1\n    Origin: https://mydomain.com\n    ```\n\n    An example of a positive response to the normal request would be as follows:\n\n    ```json\n    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://mydomain.com\n    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n\n    ```\n\n    If the specified type of API request from the specified origin is *not* allowed under the requesting account, the response status code would be 200 and the `Access-Control-...` headers would be omitted.\n</details>\n\n## CORS tutorial \n\nFor information about using CORS to implement cross-server, JavaScript-powered user interaction, see the [CORS tutorial at HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/).\n\n\n## Account security for CORS \n\nUse the CORS page \\(**Settings** \\> **Account Information and Setup** \\> **Boomi Platform API** \\> **CORS**\\) to configure CORS rules for RESTish requests in the and Partner APIs.  \n\n### CORS \n\nCORS rules govern the handling of cross-server, JavaScript-powered, RESTish API requests under an account.\n\n![](./Images/setup-ps-security-cors_67b70c09-ead9-4a3b-acde-7b4f2de5bae1.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Add Origin**  \nProvides controls for adding a CORS rule to the list. Each rule specifies:\n\n -   An origin for matching cross-server RESTish API requests under the account. The matching criteria specified for an origin are protocol \\(HTTP or HTTPS\\), originating domain, and originating port. A matching request is one that matches on all criteria.\n\n -   The allowed HTTP methods — GET, POST, DELETE — for matched requests.\n\n **Origin**    \nSpecifies the origin in URL syntax:\n\n -   Type :// as the delimiter between protocol and domain.\n\n -   If you are specifying a port explicitly, type : as the delimiter between domain and port.\n\n\nFor example: https://mydomain.com:8081.\n\nThe default ports are 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.\n\n The wildcard character \\* is permitted in the domain — for example, \\*.mydomain.com. However, specifying only \\* \\(to represent any domain\\) is not permitted.\n\n **Allowed Methods**  \n Sets the allowable HTTP methods for requests from the specified origin.\n\n **GET** - \nIf selected, GET requests are allowed.\n\n  **POST** - \nIf selected, POST requests are allowed.\n \n**DELETE** - \n If selected, DELETE requests are allowed.\n\n Highlighting a rule and clicking the Delete icon **![](./Images/main-ic-x-white-in-red-circle-16_0d0c5dc5-1c5e-4117-8a58-92c5e050ec5b.jpg)** deletes that rule.\n\n## API versioning and deprecation policy\n\nReview information about the Platform API objects' versioning and statuses, and Boomi's current policy for deprecating API objects.\n\n### API Version status\n\nAn Boomi Platform API object can have one of three statuses indicating its functional state.\n\n- **Generally Available** - A Generally Available API object is active and fully supported.\n\n- **Deprecated** - A deprecated API object is positioned for retirement at a future date. Though the object remains fully supported until its retirement date, Boomi recommends that users take advantage of newer API functionality meant to replace deprecated APIs at their earliest convenience. Operations for deprecated objects provide information in the response headers informing clients of the object’s status as well as deprecation and retirement dates.\n\n- **Retired** - A retired API object is no longer available for use. A feature retires after it is in a deprecated state for some time. Boomi recommends that users take advantage of newer API functionality to replace retired objects before their retirement date. Retired objects return a 410 error code if there is no replacement, or if available, return a 301 or 308 with a replacement URL pointing to the newer functionality.\n\nBoomi communicates deprecation and retirement plans early and often to users. For deprecation time frames, see the topic [Boomi feature deprecation process and policy](/docs/GettingStarted/Boomi_feature_deprecation_process_policy).\n\n### Support level per status\n\nReview the levels of account availability and support that are available for each status type.\n\n|  | Generally Available | Deprecated | Retired |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Account availability | Active and available to all accounts. | Active and available for existing accounts only. New accounts do not have access. | Not available for all accounts. |\n| Service-level agreement \\(SLA\\) and Support | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Available for use in production | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Documentation is supported and available | Yes | Yes | No |\n\n### Deprecation policy\n\nAlthough Boomi works to make new updates to its APIs both non-breaking and backwards compatible, there are times when an API becomes outdated and we must deprecate the API to provide improved functionality to its users. Boomi guarantees full support for deprecated APIs until their retirement date. However, Boomi encourages users to use the new replacement API functionality as soon as possible.\n\nUsers and clients receive deprecation and retirement announcements through a variety of communication channels including but not limited to:\n\n- Monthly release notes\n- API documentation\n- Direct emails\n- Developer blogs\n- API responses \n\n When interacting with deprecated API objects, the response headers may contain the following fields:\n - **Sunset**: The approximate date the API object will be removed.\n - **Warning**: A string describing any warnings related to the API call.\n - **Deprecation**: A string indicating that the API is deprecated, along with the deprecation date.\n - **Link**: A hyperlink providing more details about the deprecation of this object.\n\n Visit the deprecated object's documentation to identify newer object functionality to use instead.\n\nFor more information about Boomi's deprecation policy, refer to [Boomi feature deprecation process and policy](/docs/GettingStarted/Boomi_feature_deprecation_process_policy).\n\n### API versioning\n\nBoomi does not use incremental versioning to indicate updates made to existing Platform API objects. When updating existing Platform API objects, Boomi ensures backward compatibility for clients and does not:\n\n- Rename, remove, or change data types for existing fields\n- Change field validation rules such as adding new, required fields\n- Modify expected response codes\n\nBoomi can modify existing API objects to add new, optional fields without advance notice. In some cases, might make changes to the logic implementation of a deprecated API to work with newer application features, however the API interface remains the same for clients. Boomi documents all changes made to Generally Available and deprecated APIs publicly, and communicates with you in release notes.\n\n### Example API response\n\nThe following example shows the return HTTP response header upon accessing the deprecated endpoint for the Runtime Extensions object. Notice that the response returns headers with the object's original deprecation date, a warning message detailing the object's deprecated status, the link to the object's current documentation, and the object's future retirement \\(sunset\\) date of Saturday, February 13, 2021.\n\n```json\nDeprecation: version =\"1.0\"; date=\"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 04:00:00 GMT\"\nWarning: 299 - \"You are using a deprecated API endpoint. It will remain available until Sat, 13 Feb 2021 05:00:00 GMT. For more information see https://developer.boomi.com/docs/APIs/PlatformAPI/DeprecatedAPIs/Atom_Extensions_object .\"\nLink: <https://developer.boomi.com/docs/APIs/PlatformAPI/DeprecatedAPIs/Atom_Extensions_object;> rel=\"deprecation\" type=\"text/html\"\nSunset: Sat, 13 Feb 2021 05:00:00 GMT\n```\n\nWhen retiring an endpoint and no newer API functionality replaces the object, the retired object returns a 410 error code in the response. When retiring an endpoint and new API functionality is available, the retired object returns a 301 or 308 error code and a link to Documentation detailing the replacement object.\n\n\n## Enabling CORS support for Platform and Partner APIs \n\nEnable CORS support on the CORS page \\(**Settings** \\> **Account Information and Setup** \\> **Boomi Platform API** \\> **CORS**\\).\n\n### Procedure\n\n1.  Select **Settings** \\> **Account Information and Setup** and click **CORS** under **Boomi Platform API**.\n\n    The CORS page is displayed.\n\n2.  Click **Add Origin**.\n\n    Controls for specifying a CORS rule appear in the rules list below.\n\n3.  In the **Origin** field for the new rule, specify an origin using URL syntax.\n\n    Origins are used for matching cross-server RESTish API requests under the account by protocol \\(HTTP or HTTPS\\), originating domain, and originating port.\n\n4.  Turn on the check box for each HTTP method \\(GET, POST, DELETE\\) that you want to allow for requests under the account from the specified origin.\n\n5.  For each additional CORS rule that you want to specify, repeat steps 2–4.  \n\n6.  Click **Save**. \n\n ## Deprecated APIs \n\n Refer to the list of deprecated APIs that are not available in this OpenAPI specification: \n\n [Deprecated Platform APIs](/docs/category/deprecated-apis)",

It is similar to opening and viewing a component's XML from the **Revision History** panel on the user interface's **Build** tab. \n You can use the Component object to: \n -   Perform static code analysis and validation using external tools for code quality or following coding standards. \n -   Perform textual version differentials using external tools. \n -   Search component XML for specific configuration elements using external tools. \n -   Migrate from other tools by creating integration components. \n -   Generate process configuration documentation and dependency reports. \n -   Archive deployment and component metadata for compliance requirements. \n\n You can use the Component object to retrieve additional, complimentary information to what the [Component Metadata object](/api/platformapi#tag/ComponentMetadata) provides. \n\n For example, if you use the Component Metadata object to get the component type, you can then use the Component object to find its XML structure, or to see if a process-type component contains the `processOverrides` XML. The Component object additionally returns a component's full folder path in the Component Explorer hierarchy, as well as the component's user-defined description \\(if specified\\). \n\n **Sensitive data** \n\n Any password-type fields, such as private certificates, are masked using a cryptographic hash. Though your actual password value is masked and re-encrypted with a one-way algorithm, the result is a value that cannot be decrypted but can be used to detect if the password value changed between versions. \n\n ### Restoring a component \n\n To Restore a component you must have Read and Write access and a valid `componentId` of an existing deleted component. When restoring a component, the component will not be renamed or moved, and its parent folder will also be restored. This will NOT create a new component. \n\n ### Component types\n\nUse the following table to determine the component types available for use within the Component object. Note that connector subtype fields are not defined in the table; subtype values exactly match the various connector types that you can select from the **Build** tab on the user interface, and can be retrieved using the [Connector object](/api/platformapi#tag/Connector).\n\n|Component type field|Component type description|\n|--------------------|--------------------------|\n|certificate|X.509 Certificate|\n|certificate.pgp|PGP Certificate|\n|connector-action|Connector Operation|\n|connector-settings|Connector Connection|\n|crossref|Cross Reference Table|\n|documentcache|Document Cache|\n|transform.map|Map|\n|transform.function|Map Function|\n|process|Process|\n|processproperty|Process Property|\n|profile.db|Database Profile|\n|profile.edi|EDI Profile|\n|profile.flatfile|Flat File Profile|\n|profile.xml|XML Profile|\n|profile.json|JSON Profile|\n|queue|Queue|\n|tradingpartner|Trading Partner|\n|tpgroup|Processing Group|\n|tporganization|Organization|\n|tpcommoptions|Communication Channel|\n|webservice|API Service|\n|webservice.external|API Proxy|\n|processroute|Process Route|\n|customlibrary|Custom Library|\n|flowservice|Flow Service|\n|script.processing|Process Script|\n|script.mapping|Map Script|\n|xslt|XSLT Stylesheet| \n\n ### Considerations by Component Type \n\n ### Profiles\n\n- Profile elements must be created individually.

Send a POST request to the Execution Request object with a request body that specifies both the ID of the process that you want to run and the desired Runtime  on which to run the process. The response returns a requestId. \n 2.  Using the requestId returned in Step 1, make a subsequent call to the Execution Record object to retrieve detailed information about the process run \\(in other words, the run record\\). \n 3.  Repeatedly poll the Execution Record object with the requestId until the run record is available. If the `ExecutionRecord` is not available yet, it returns an HTTP 202 status code. \n\n ### Benefits of using the Execution Request object\n\nThe Execution Request object leverages the existing functionality provided by the [Execute Process operation](/api/platformapi#tag/ExecuteProcess). Although both are available for use, Boomi recommends using the Execution Request object. The Execution Request object provides these additional benefits:\n\n - A means for you to correlate the run request to the actual run, which helps a developer know whether a test passed or failed in the result.\n - Support for passing process property component property values in addition to dynamic process properties. Currently, the Execute Process operation supports passing dynamic process properties only.\n - Additional validations to ensure that you deploy process properly and can be run.\n - Returns a `requestId` that you can use in a subsequent call to the Execution Record object. The Execute Process operation does not return a `requestId` value. \n\n > **Note:**\n> - This API object accepts dynamic process properties and process properties components. Their specified values override corresponding values persisted from previous runs. The dynamic process property names must match exactly.\n>\n> - For additional clarity, the properties you provide in the request override persisted properties or extensions. This object does not validate property component IDs, property keys, or field values. The object does not error in these cases, and as a result, those properties are not set.\n>\n> - Also, if environment extensions are used to set property values, those values override anything passed in the API call."

For a deeper dive into understanding the relationships and usability between each of these APIs, see the Community article [How to get integration process execution details with the AtomSphere API](https://community.boomi.com/s/article/How-to-get-integration-process-execution-details-with-the-AtomSphere-API). \n  \n You can use the Rerun Document operation to reprocess either all documents for a given run by status, or individual documents \\(also known as Generic Connector Records\\) in a process run. \n A common usage pattern to rerun individual documents \\(Generic Connector Records\\) is to: \n 1.  First, query for a particular [Execution Record object](/api/platformapi#tag/ExecutionRecord) record. \n 2.  Next, retrieve the [ExecutionConnector](/api/platformapi#tag/ExecutionConnector) where `startShape=`true. The ExecutionConnector API response includes is `StartShape=`true or `StartShape=`false, and if true, you can rerun the record. \n 3.  Then, retrieve the [GenericConnectorRecords](/api/platformapi#tag/GenericConnectorRecord) by `status=`ERROR \\(most common\\) for a particular ExecutionConnector record. \n 4.  Call `RerunDocument` with the collection of GenericConnectorRecord IDs generated from the GenericConnectorRecords object in Step 3. \n 5.  Finally, use the [ExecutionRecord object](/api/platformapi#tag/ExecutionRecord) with the requestId returned from the `RerunDocument` request, to get the result of the retry run."

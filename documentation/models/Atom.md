| is_cloud_attachment | bool               | ❌       | Indicates if a Runtime is a Cloud Attachment. It is set to `True` for the Cloud Attachment; otherwise, it is False for other Runtime. It is only populated for Cloud Attachments and Cloud runtime clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| name                | str                | ❌       | A user-defined name for the Runtime, Runtime cluster, or Runtime cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| purge_history_days  | int                | ❌       | The number of days after a process run when the purging of logs, processed documents, and temporary data occurs. The default is 30 days. The maximum is 9999. A value of 0 disables purging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| purge_immediate     | bool               | ❌       | If true, purges processed documents and temporary data immediately after a process ends. If you set this to true, also set purgeHistoryDays to a value greater than 0, such as 1. This combination not only purges your data right away, but also runs an extra cleanup process on a daily basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

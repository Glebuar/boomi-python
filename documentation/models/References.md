# ReferencesType

The type of reference component. - A value of DEPENDENT indicates that the component is included automatically in a process at packaging and deployment time. - A value of INDEPENDENT indicates the component is standalone, and you must package and deploy it individually and manually, though you might use it in a process configuration.
